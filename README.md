# Learning Rust with "The Rust Programming Language"

This repository contains my exercises, projects, and notes as I learn Rust by following the book **[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)** by *Steve Klabnik* and *Carol Nichols*.


## Purpose of the Repository

This repository is a personal learning space to:
- Practice Rust programming concepts through hands-on exercises and projects.
- Track my progress as I work through the book.
- Serve as a reference for future projects and refreshers.

## Repository Structure

The projects and exercises are organized by chapter.


Each folder contains a `cargo`-based Rust project corresponding to the exercises in that chapter.

## Progress

- [x] **Chapter 1**: Getting Started
- [x] **Chapter 2**: Programming a Guessing Game
- [ ] **Chapter 3**: Common Programming Concepts
- [ ] **Chapter 4**: Understanding Ownership
- [ ] **Chapter 5**: Using Structs to Structure Related Data
- [ ] **More to come.**

## Running the Code

To run any of the exercises or projects:

1. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Chapter02/guessing_game
   ```
2. Use cargo run to compile and execute the code:
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
